For the final project, we designed a fitness tracking app. The app has three main pages: Home, Record, and Profile. The app enables users to track workouts by logging type, duration, and calories burned, with this data then visualized on the Home page "energy" section and through progress metrics on the "Thriving Percentage". This encourages users to engage in consistent activity and monitor progress toward their personal fitness goals. 

In the Profile page, users can set their goals of sleep and stand hours, the steps, and daily calories cosumed. All of these information will be appeared in the home page.

Firebase supports persistent storage of user workouts and profile settings, ensuring that user data is synced and updated in real time. The layout and navigation are optimized for mobile with a clean, modular UI.
